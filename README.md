# Automatic_Street-Lighting_Project
This repository contains the code and documentation for an Automatic Street Lighting System project that utilizes Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs) for sunlight monitoring. This project aims to design and develop an intelligent street lighting system that optimizes energy consumption, reduces light pollution, enhances safety, and streamlines maintenance operations.

Features

Energy Efficiency: The system adjusts the brightness of streetlights based on real-time sunlight levels, minimizing energy wastage during daylight hours.
Light Pollution Reduction: By modulating the intensity of streetlights according to ambient natural light, the system minimizes light pollution and its adverse effects.

Safety Enhancement: Adaptive lighting ensures optimal visibility and safety for pedestrians and vehicles, responding to changes in natural light levels.
